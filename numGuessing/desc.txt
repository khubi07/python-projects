generating a random num and track many times it take the user to guess
the num
for this import random
random.randrange(start,stop)
you can also use --> randint
where stop is not included
when user enters a num it will be in form of string to 
convert it in num do 
int(num) but int("hello") where num is not a digit then -> error
hence ensure num entered by user is a digit by .isdigit
use if else for this

repeat same step when user guess

to count no. of guesses create a guess variable to store the count
every time loop runs guess + 1

now lets give an ease for user
narror down their guess using if else
