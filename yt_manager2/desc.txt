-creating youtube manager with sqlite3 database
-refering 1st method to youtube_manager without db
-closign connection at end is best practice
-for all functions we use cursor.execute() to execute functions

choice 2:
in 1st method we called add_videos() whch added video in file 
but now we are using db
