this is a medium level project
to store passwords along with the user name and their associated accounts
in a text file 
the stored passwords will be all encrypted (not in the form of plain text)

encrypted pass will need master password(key) for decryption

first ask the master pass from user to encrypt pass
if the pass enter by user is wrong, th ecode still works but pass will not be shown
creating two function for writing and reteeiving key

write_key() -> using generate method it generates key and store in key 
key.key file is created in wb mode and then write in file
once u call the func key file will be created and then comment out write_key func (no further neeed)

load_key() ->open key.key, read file, then close adn return the key


next user wwil be asked whether they want to add or view pass
all this be enclosed in while loop

add() -> ask for account and name, then store it in a file(if file doesnt exist create one)
"with" keyword automatically closes the file 
note->w mode  it opens already existing file and overwrites
r - only allow to read already existing files
a - opens file or creates the one if does not exist and allow to add on

view() ->open file in r mode then read each lines using f.readlines through for loop

due to "/n" when user views pass an extra line is occuring to fix this 
use line.rstrip() it will strip off extra line

split is used to separate acc name and pass

pipe "|" operator is inserted after each word and the output
is returned in the form of list
